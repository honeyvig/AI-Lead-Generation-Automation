Data must be accurate and up to date based on StoreLeads' latest records.

Requirements:
- Must have an active StoreLeads subscription with the ability to extract the required data.
- Experience in data extraction and formatting for LinkedIn Ads or similar platforms is preferred.

Can you please advise my how many companies meet this criteria and how many hours this project will take to complete?
------
To complete this project, you will need to extract and filter data based on the provided criteria from StoreLeads and then structure it in the required CSV format for LinkedIn Ads targeting.

Here’s a breakdown of what needs to be done:
Steps for Data Extraction and Formatting

    StoreLeads Subscription:
        Ensure that you have an active StoreLeads subscription. StoreLeads is a service that provides detailed data about eCommerce stores, including sales estimates, platform usage, country, and other business data.
        If you don't already have a subscription, you’ll need to sign up and access their API (if available).

    Filter Criteria:
        Platforms: Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce.
        Status: Active stores.
        Country: Australia.
        Estimated Sales: Filter for the following sales ranges:
            $250k - $500k/month
            $500k - $1M/month
            $1M - $5M/month
            $5M+ per month

    Required Data Points: Extract the required 9 data points for each company. These data points should be included in the CSV file formatted correctly for LinkedIn Ads targeting.

    CSV Format: Ensure the output CSV file includes the required fields, such as company name, platform, estimated sales, location, etc., for LinkedIn Ads.

Python Code for Data Extraction and Formatting

Here’s a general Python script for extracting and filtering data (assuming the StoreLeads API or a dataset is accessible):

import requests
import csv

# Assuming StoreLeads API endpoint and your API key
STORELEADS_API_URL = "https://api.storeleads.io"  # Replace with actual StoreLeads API URL
API_KEY = "your_api_key"  # Replace with your StoreLeads API key

# Define the filter criteria
PLATFORMS = ["Shopify", "WooCommerce", "BigCommerce"]
COUNTRY = "Australia"
SALES_RANGES = [
    {"min": 250000, "max": 500000},
    {"min": 500000, "max": 1000000},
    {"min": 1000000, "max": 5000000},
    {"min": 5000000, "max": float('inf')}
]

# Create headers for the CSV file
CSV_HEADERS = ["Company Name", "Platform", "Sales Estimate", "Country", "Website", "LinkedIn", "Contact Name", "Phone", "Email"]

# Function to fetch store data from StoreLeads API
def fetch_data_from_storeleads():
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"}
    response = requests.get(f"{STORELEADS_API_URL}/stores", headers=headers)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()  # Assuming JSON response
    else:
        print("Error fetching data from StoreLeads.")
        return []

# Filter the data based on criteria
def filter_stores(data):
    filtered_stores = []
    
    for store in data:
        platform = store.get("platform", "")
        sales = store.get("estimated_sales", 0)
        country = store.get("country", "")
        
        if platform in PLATFORMS and country == COUNTRY:
            for sales_range in SALES_RANGES:
                if sales_range["min"] <= sales < sales_range["max"]:
                    filtered_stores.append({
                        "Company Name": store.get("company_name", ""),
                        "Platform": platform,
                        "Sales Estimate": f"${sales:,}",
                        "Country": country,
                        "Website": store.get("website", ""),
                        "LinkedIn": store.get("linkedin", ""),
                        "Contact Name": store.get("contact_name", ""),
                        "Phone": store.get("phone", ""),
                        "Email": store.get("email", "")
                    })
                    break  # No need to check other ranges once matched
    return filtered_stores

# Write the filtered data to a CSV file
def write_to_csv(filtered_stores):
    with open('targeted_companies.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=CSV_HEADERS)
        writer.writeheader()
        writer.writerows(filtered_stores)

# Main function
def main():
    store_data = fetch_data_from_storeleads()
    if store_data:
        filtered_stores = filter_stores(store_data)
        write_to_csv(filtered_stores)
        print(f"Extracted {len(filtered_stores)} companies that match the criteria.")
    else:
        print("No data available or an error occurred.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Breakdown of Code:

    API Call: The script fetches data from the StoreLeads API using a GET request with your API key for authentication.
    Filtering: The script filters the stores based on the criteria, such as platform (Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce), country (Australia), and sales estimates.
    Data Extraction: It extracts the required data points (company name, platform, estimated sales, country, etc.) for each matching store.
    CSV Generation: The filtered data is written to a CSV file (targeted_companies.csv) in a format suitable for LinkedIn Ads targeting.

Project Timeline Estimation:

The time to complete this project will vary depending on:

    The number of companies in the StoreLeads database.
    The complexity of filtering the data.
    The time it takes to clean and format the data correctly for the CSV output.

Here’s an approximate breakdown:

    Data Extraction from StoreLeads API: 1-2 hours (depending on the API response speed and data size).
    Data Filtering: 1-2 hours to apply the correct filters (platform, sales ranges, and country).
    CSV Formatting and Writing: 1 hour to structure the data into the required CSV format.
    Testing and Debugging: 1-2 hours for ensuring the data is correct and the script runs smoothly.

Total Estimated Time: 3-5 hours.

This estimate assumes that:

    The StoreLeads API is functioning and returns the necessary data.
    The filtering and extraction process works without significant issues.

Final Deliverables:

    A CSV file containing the filtered companies with the required data points for LinkedIn Ads targeting.

Final Thoughts:

If you have access to the StoreLeads API, the code should work seamlessly. The main task here is filtering the data based on the criteria and ensuring it’s properly formatted for LinkedIn Ads.
